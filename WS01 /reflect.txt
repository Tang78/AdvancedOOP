1}While completing this task I learned 1. Operator Overloading2. Rule of 3 3. Static Command4. Linkage5. Helper Functions My read function could not read into my dynamically allocated memory, but I had to create a temporary value that I will copy into my dynamically allocated memory2}The difference between internal and external linkage citing examples from your codeExternal linkage is visibility and accessibility of identifiers across different source files in a program but in Internal linkage it is invisible across different source files in a program. The variables extern double g_taxrate;extern double g_discount;are defined in the header class and not included in the namespace but are still used everywhere in the file. This is an example of external linkage.3}what are static variables and how are they useful in your solution.It used to count the number of times a function is called e.g., our counter variable is static, so it gives a count of the number of times the function is being called.4)The changes that you made in upgrading your RideRequest class in part 2.I made use of dynamic memory so that based on the size of the string the program will provide the space .
